=head1 NAME

crap - just don't take any

=head1 VERSION

version 0.06

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  no crap;

  # strict and warnings are enabled

  $foo = 'bar'; # wrong

  use crap;

  # no strictures or warnings now

  $bar = 'foo' # This is 'okay' now

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Enables L<strict> and L<warnings> without all the typing.

It also makes C<STDOUT> 'hot' turning off buffering.

To enable just type C<no crap> in your script.

C<use crap> disables L<strict> and L<warnings> and restores
previous settings to C<STDOUT> bufferingness.
