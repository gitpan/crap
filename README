NAME
    crap - just don't take any

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
      no crap;

      # strict and warnings are enabled

      $foo = 'bar'; # wrong

      use crap;

      # no strictures or warnings now

      $bar = 'foo' # This is 'okay' now

DESCRIPTION
    Enables strict and warnings without all the typing.

    It also makes "STDOUT" 'hot' turning off buffering.

    To enable just type "no crap" in your script.

    "use crap" disables strict and warnings and restores previous settings
    to "STDOUT" bufferingness.
